## Jetpack Compose Projects
- [Unit Converter](https://github.com/abhineshchandra1234/UnitConverter)
    - we will create a unit converter app using a basic jetpack compose
    - It will convert values from input to output units and vice-versa
    - Whenever we change input or output units or values, the result is automatically updated
- [My Shopping List App](https://github.com/abhineshchandra1234/MyShoppingListApp)
    - Created a basic shopping list app using Jetpack Compose
    - Users can add shopping items and their quantity
    - When the user closes the app all data is lost as it is not stored locally yet
- [Counter App](https://github.com/abhineshchandra1234/CounterMVVM)
    - Created a counter app using basic jetpack compose and MVVM architecture
    - we can increment or decrement the counter and the counter will survive or remain the same on configuration change.
